```shell
Self address is: /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/59476/p2p/12D3KooWPePRG6BDdjgtEYmPDxNyJfMWpQ1Rwgefuz9eqksLfxJb
```

then you could setup another node by this command:

```shell
starcoin -n dev --seed /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/59476/p2p/12D3KooWPePRG6BDdjgtEYmPDxNyJfMWpQ1Rwgefuz9eqksLfxJb

```

You could use subcommand console to start cli console:

```shell
starcoin -n dev console
```

repeat these steps, you cloud get multi node local dev network.
